pierre_joseph_proudhon;Pèire-Josep Prudhon;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
pierre_joseph_proudhon_desc;Prudhon was apprenticed as a printer and became interested in politics after he was involved in the printing of early socialist and feminist publications. Prudhon now turned to writing, and in 1843 published 'Qu'es Aquò la Proprietat?'. In the book, Prudhon attacks the injustices of inequality and coined the phrase 'property is theft'. Prudhon published his most important work, System of Economic Contradictions, in 1846. Marx responded to Prudhon's book by writing The Poverty of Philosophy (1847). This was the beginning of the long-term struggle of ideas between the two men. Prudhon was opposed to Marx's authoritarianism and his main influence was on the libertarian socialist movement.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
jean_jaurès;Joan de Castras;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
jean_jaurès_desc;De Castras began his political career as a moderate. Following the violent dispersal by police of a soapbox speaker's streedside audience, he became increasingly radical in his political views and after reading Marx's works he began advocating socialism. He was not a revolutionary and supported the Independent Socialists. While still organizing local labor clubs, de Castras completed his mammoth Socialist History of the Nations. He also joined with Aristides Briant and Renatus Vivianh in 1904 to establish the left-wing newspaper 'Humanitas' in 1904. A new Socialist Party under Joan de Castras grew rapidly at the beginning of the century but split over the correct response to foreign militarism. De Castras advocated a policy of international arbitration whereas others supported armed intervention.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

john_maynard_keynes;Joan de Cahanis;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
john_maynard_keynes_desc;A Occitan economist who challenged the orthodox view of the role of the State in the management of economic forces in society and the relationship between supply and demand in times of economic crisis. Drawing upon the abilities of states to mobilize their economies during wars with other industrial nations, Cahanis maintained that the State could use its influence to promote more efficient economic development. But his most radical theory involved the role of aggregate demand in the economy, arguing that it was demand, not supply, that was the final determinant in the levels of output and growth that an economy could produce, and that in times of economic slowdown or crisis, the solution to the crisis involved revival of demand to absorb excess supply and create the conditions for a revival of production to meet further increases in demand. While his theories had many critics, they became highly influential as the twentieth century progressed.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

joseph_schumpeter;Mari Djata Bal;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
joseph_schumpeter_desc;After a quick doctorate at Kangaba, Mari Djata Bal roamed about as something of a footloose advocate until he rejoined academia in 1909. It was while he was teaching at Timbuktu that he wrote his Theory of Economic Development (1911), where he first outlined his famous theory of entrepreneurship. He argued those daring spirits, entrepreneurs, created technical and financial innovations in the face of competition and falling profits - and that it was these spurts of activity which generated (irregular) economic growth. In 1919, Bal became the Malian Minister of Finance - unfortunately, presiding over the hyperinflation of the period, and thus was dismissed later that year. Although excelling as a teacher above everything, Mari Djata Bal nonetheless completed three more books while at Timbuktu: his two-volume work Business Cycles (1939), and his popular Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy (1942) - in which he famously predicted the downfall of capitalism by the hands of intellectuals.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
